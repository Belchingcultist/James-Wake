            Hello and welcome! I now have a website where you can find me, my
            writing, and any news about my writing! Currently that's only one
            novel and a series of short stories over on the WORKS page, but the
            sequel to THE SAPPHIRE SHADOW should be released later this month.

                  Nadia loves jewels. Big ones, small ones, red ones, blue ones.
                  But her favorite variety is the illegally acquired. She has
                  more than enough money to buy the best. That’s never been the
                  point. Shoplifting is her hobby, her escape. When her high
                  school friend, Tess, offers to help her break into real
                  burglary, how could she refuse? Tess is a technical genius -
                  she designed and built her own right arm. Surely she can take
                  down any security standing in their way to bigger and better
                  loot.

                    Outside the city walls, Jackson was raised in the slums.
                    Life as a refugee was never easy, and the only way out was
                    joining the army. Now she’s a cop, finally living inside the
                    old sea walls. She’s supposed to be hunting Cheshire, a
                    reclusive hacktivist stirring up unrest, but the nightly
                    news is full of a smug young woman breaking the law and
                    getting away with it, blowing kisses as she escapes police
                    and private security. Theatrical, daring heists, thrilling
                    to watch. And Jackson hates every minute of it.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Meanwhile, the city they both call home is slowly tearing
                    itself apart around them. Jackson crushes riot after riot,
                    just part of the job. But more and more it feels wrong,
                    hopeless, no point to any of it, no future for any of them.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Nadia has given up on the future. But more and more people
                    see her escapades and realize they can fight back. It
                    doesn’t make sense to Nadia, not at first, but an unlikely
                    romance starts to show her that there could be some hope,
                    even in a broken world.
